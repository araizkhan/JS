# Passenger-Counter-app
Hi! This is my first Javascript project.
This is a simple webpage which has a counter implemented in it for counting passengers ona train.
The increment increases the count by 1.
The save button saves and displays the recent count on the screen and set the counter to 0.
You can use counter for multiple times and it will display all the recent counts on the screen.
